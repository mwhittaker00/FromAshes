A browser-based multiplayer game written in PHP. Set in a post-apocalypse, the game design aimed to encourage players to work together to build their communities while dealing with the politics of selecting and following leaders in a lawless world.

Features:
- Users create their own "Survivor" and are then placed into a default community, "The Wasteland"
- Users can move to user-created Camps. 
- Users can support one other user. The user with the most supporters becomes the Camp Leader.
- Camp Leaders can change a camp's description and exile other survivors to The Wasteland.
- Camp Leaders cannot exile another survivor who has a supporter, forcing leaders to first kick out their target's supporters. This forces leaders to consider the consequences of exiling popular figures, since kicking out the other members could have political ramification and would impact the available skills and resources for the entire camp. Two users can cross-support each other to fully protect themselves from exile.
- Users can perform an action every four hours. Actions consist of things such has hunting, gathering, scouting, etc. 
- Users have a set of skills, and those skills increase based on the user's actions. Hunting improves the Guns, Traps, and Tracking skills.
- Higher skills result in higher rewards from actions.
- Camps include a group message board where members communicate with one another.
- Survivors can communicate through private messenging.
